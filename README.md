3. Increases Retention
People remember images and stories better than plain text.
Infographics and charts break down data into digestible pieces.
4. Makes Learning More Engaging
Interactive diagrams, videos, and real-world scenarios keep audiences interested.
5. Reduces Cognitive Load
A step-by-step visual guide (e.g., screenshots for software tutorials) prevents overwhelming users.

## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
1. Diagrams (Flowcharts, Schematics, Block Diagrams)
Best for: Explaining processes, workflows, and system architecture
Example: A flowchart showing how data moves through a network.
2. Charts (Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter)
Best for: Representing numerical data, trends, and comparisons
Examples:
Bar charts – Comparing performance of different algorithms.
Line charts – Showing CPU usage over time.
Pie charts – Breaking down disk space usage.
3. Infographics
